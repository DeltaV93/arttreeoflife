					<h4 id="text">Students in the Public Art class and community members at CSUN painted a mural commemorating several artists including, <span class="red">Frida Kahlo</span>, <span class="red">Ana Mendieta</span>, and <span class="red">Andy Warhol</span>. This mural also portrays the journey that students take specifically in the art department (silhouettes throughout the mural). At the end, this mural acknowledges those students that graduate as well as their families. </h4>
